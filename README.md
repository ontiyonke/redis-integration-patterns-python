# Enterprise Integration Patterns with Redis and Python  

A series of Jupyter/IPython notebooks where we explain how to implement different Enterprise Integration Patterns using the Redis data structures server.  

## Dependencies  

- A running [Redis](http://redis.io/) server.    
- A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) server to run the notebooks if needed.   
- We used [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) as a Python client for Redis.   

## First steps  

##### An introduction to Redis with Python  

In this notebook, we will go thourhg a similar set of commands as those described in the [Redis Data Types introduction](http://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro) but using the [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py) Python client from a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org).
